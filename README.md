I made this simple bucket list application for android to understand the basics of Photoshop and Illustrator and to create a play store ready app with image optimization and proguard to shrink, optimize and obfuscate the Java code.

The icons for application were created using Photoshop and Illustrator.

The application consists of the following android features:

1. Basic components of Android (Activities, Services, Intents, Fragments, and BroadcastReceivers)
2. Drawables and selectors
3. Efficient Image Loading With Glide
4. Fragments, FragmentManager and FragmentTransaction
5. Realm database and queries
6. RecyclerView, sections, animation and swipe to delete
7. Styles and themes
8. Custom Widgets and Views
9. Running periodic tasks with IntentService, AlarmManager and BootReceiver
10. Proguard to shrink, optimize and obfuscate the Java code.
